# Physics Simulation

Simple and robust simulation of bodies running (hopefully) in real time.

# Setup
- use premake5 for easy compile and linking. Using [this premake tutorial](https://github.com/premake/premake-core/wiki/Tutorial-Premake-example-with-GLFW-and-OpenGL) and [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/opengl/comments/rerqhf/simple_glfw_application_template_and_instructions/) as well as [this github boilerplate](https://github.com/HectorPeeters/opengl_premake_boilerplate) to set it up for linux.

# Dependencies
- glfw
- glad
